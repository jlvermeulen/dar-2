She's got just a touch of grey and her hair
and that's ok, she knows that I don't care
The little lines around her eyes
She don't need to disguise

In her heart she's by the ocean
the sun on her face
or going down the road less traveled
at her own pace

She's a natural in everything she does
she don't have to try to win my love
I go easy when she calls
She knows how to please me
after all, she's a natural

When I really need her touch
when this old world is just too much
Well I don't have to say a word
Because her heart is already heard

But it must be second nature
the way she knows
she takes my hand and then she turns
the light down low

She's a natural in everything she does
she don't have to try to win my love
I go easy when she calls
She knows how to please me
after all, she's a natural
