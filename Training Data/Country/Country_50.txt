Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street
at Heartbreak Hotel.

Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die.

And although it's always crowded,
you still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
do cry away their gloom.

Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die.

Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.

Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die.

Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
and you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
to Heartbreak Hotel.

You'll be so lonely, baby
You'll be so lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die

Although its always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
to cry away the blues

Heartbrek is so lonely, baby
It is so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die
