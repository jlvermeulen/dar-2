Now once upon a time in a nursery rhyme
Three little men got lost
Like you and me they couldn't agree
And upon the wave they tossed

Well, I'll sing their tune 'cause I got marooned
With the love I can't forget
Now the three little men just took me in
On an ocean of regret

With a rub-a-dub-dub, three men in the tub
Lost on the ocean blue
I roll like a hub, sing, rub-a-dub-dub
'Cause you broke my heart in two

Well, my heart is sore and I can't reach shore
And I'm driftin' far away
From the love I had and I'm feelin' mighty bad
And I can't go on this way

Won't you throw out the line and say you're mine
And take me back again
'Cause my rudder's broke and it ain't no joke
Won't you reach and pull me in

With a rub-a-dub-dub, three men in the tub
Lost on the ocean blue
I roll like a hub, sing, rub-a-dub-dub
'Cause you broke my heart in two

Well, I knew right away there'd never come a day
When I'd reach land again
The one I 'dore on the distant shore
Is now at rainbow's end

To the three little guys, I turn my eyes
Won't you tell your names to me
Now one said Fate, one said Hate
And the other said Jealousy

With a rub-a-dub-dub, three men in the tub
Lost on the ocean blue
I roll like a hub, sing, rub-a-dub-dub
'Cause you broke my heart in two
