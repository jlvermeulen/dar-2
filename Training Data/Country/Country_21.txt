Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh 
Well I see a pretty girl walking down the street 
uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh 
Well I see a pretty girl walking down the street 
I'm gonna walk right up I'm gonna say real sweet 
Uh-huh-huh, mm, mm, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh-huh-huh 
Well I say hey baby, baby who's your guy 
uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh 
Well I say hey baby, baby who's your guy
Cause he can't love as good as I 
Uh-huh-huh, mm, mm, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh-huh-huh 
She looks into my eyes, we both are hypnotized 
She puts her hand in mine afraid she'll jerk around and hurt my spine 
Well my baby's kisses are jet propelled 
uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh 
Well my baby's kisses are jet propelled 
And man oh man she makes me feel so well 
Uh-huh-huh, mm, mm, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh-huh-huh 
She looks into my eyes, we both are hypnotized 
She puts her hand in mine afraid she'll jerk around and hurt my spine 
Well my baby's kisses are jet propelled 
uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh 
Well my baby's kisses are jet propelled 
And man oh man she makes me feel so well 
Uh-huh-huh, mm, mm, uh-huh-huh, huh-huh-huh-huh
