I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child who's grown old

If dreams were thunder
And lightning was desire
This old house would've burned down
A long time ago

(Chorus)
Make me an angel
That flies from montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl
When I had me a cowboy
He wasn't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time
And no matter how i tried
The years just flew by
Like a broken down dam

(Repeat Chorus)

There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear all them buzzin'
And I ain't done nothing 
Since I woke up today
But how can a person
Go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening
And have nothing to say

(Repeat Chorus)

To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
