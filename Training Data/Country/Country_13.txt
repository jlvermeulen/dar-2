Well I went down to leon's
To see that baby of mine
Yeah I went downtown
To see that baby of mine
Lord the joint was jumping
And everyone was hitting that wine, wine, wine
Drinking wine all the time
Will make you crazy and lose your mind
When they got goin' it was Saturday night
And they kept on drinkin' till broad daylight

[Chorus]
Those cats were gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Honky tonkin' all night long
Gone, gone, gone

Ain't no use in sleepin' in the summertime [Repeat: x2]
If you want to get to sleep
You best start messin'
With the wine, wine, wine
Drinking wine all the time
Will make you crazy and lose your mind
When I got goin' it was four o'clock
And I drank so much that I couldn't stop

Them cats were gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Juke joint jumpin'
All night long
Gone, gone, gone
