I used to play around with hearts that hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh
(Uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)

She played around and teased me with her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me but her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh
(Uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)

She told me how she cared for me and that we'd never part
And so for the very first time I gave away my heart

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh
(Uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)

The next day she was gone and I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart, won her victory

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh
(Uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)

But I'd played this game with other hearts but I never thought I'd see
The day when someone else would play love's foolish game with me

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh
(Uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh
(Uh huh, poor little fool)
