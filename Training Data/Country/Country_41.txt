Yippee yeah, there'll be no wedding bells for today!

I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't ya glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

Oh, Lily Bell, oh, Lily Bell,
Though I may have done some foolin, this is why I never fell

I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't ya glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

Oh, Mary Ann, oh, Mary Ann
Though I've done some moonlight walking this is why I up and went

I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't ya glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

Oh, Sally Jane, oh, Sally Jane
Though I'd love to stay forever this is why I can't remain

I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't ya glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

Oh, Bessy Lou, oh, Bessy Lou
Though we've done a heap of dreamin' this is why it won't come true

I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't ya glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

So I'll go jingling, a-jangling a-jingling along
