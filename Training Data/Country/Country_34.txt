South of the border, hey, I know a lad,
He's got more fun than anybody's had,
Don't got no worry, don't got no dough,
Everybody's wondering 'bout Mexican Joe.
In old Mexico, they call him the Rhumba King,
Leads all the women around on a string,
When they go out, they get a million thrills,
But the lovely senoritas wind up with the bills.

Dancin', romancin',
Always on the go,
Sun shinin' down on Mexican Joe

He makes the night spots all along the bay,
People want to see him when he comes their way,
He spreads so much joy everywhere he goes,
Everyone shouts "Viva la Mexican Joe."
He likes to gamble, at poker he's an ace,
He's always lucky with the cards that got a face,
At winning the money, he is sure a whiz,
But when they win they don't collect 
'cause they don't know where he is. 

Dancin', romancin',
Always on the go,
Sun shinin' down on Mexican Joe

He don't no income tax 'cause he don't got no dough,
Still he gets along just fine, how we'll never know,
He's got everything he wants, a girl, a drink, a song,
If we use his formula, we surely can't go wrong.
His favorite playground is anywhere there's girls,
He's got that somethin' that sets their hearts a-whirl,
It couldn't be his money 'cause he ain't got a peso,
But when he wants a kiss all he's got to do is say so 

Dancin', romancin',
Always on the go,
Sun shinin' down on Mexican Joe
