Well I never felt more like singing the blues
Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear why'd you do me this way

Well I never felt more like crying all night
Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right
Without you you got me singing the blues

The moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do but cry over you

Well I never felt more like running away
But why should I go cause I couldn't stay
Without you you got me singing the blues

Well I never felt more like running away...
