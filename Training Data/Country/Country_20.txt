Everybody's goin' out and havin' fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and havin' none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see
Oh, lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me

Oh, lonesome me

Well I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me
Oh, lonesome me
Oh, lonesome me
