Pardon me, if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
When you're gone yet I dream a little dream as years go by 
Now and then there's a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I

(Now and then there's a fool such as I)

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I
