Everywhere you go
Sunshine follows you
Everywhere you go
Skies are always blue

Children love you, they seem to know
You bring the roses out of the snow
The whole world says "Hello"
Everywhere you go

Everywhere you go
Sunshine follows you
Everywhere you go
Skies are always blue

Children love you, they seem to know
You bring roses out of the snow
The whole world says "Hello"
Everywhere you go

Everywhere
Everywhere that you go
Everywhere that you go
Everywhere that you go
Sunshine follows you

Everywhere
Everywhere that you go
Everywhere that you go
Everywhere that you go
Skies are always blue
The skies are always blue

Children love you, they seem to know
You bring the roses out of the snow
The whole world says "Hello"
Everywhere you go

Children love you, they seem to know
You bring roses out of the snow
The whole world says "Hello"
Everywhere you go
