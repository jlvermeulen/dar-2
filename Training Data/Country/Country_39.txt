If you're ever lonely darling think of all that I've been through
Long and lonesome nights sweetheart, I've waited on you
Say in your mind you have it coming and you know you have to pay
Maybe, baby you will learn and change someday

Why oh why did you try to deceive me?
You've made me blue sweetheart, both night and day
Say in your mind you have it coming and you know you have to pay
Maybe, baby you will learn and change someday

Why oh why did you try to deceive me?
You've made me blue sweetheart both night and day
Say in your mind you have it coming and you know you have to pay
Maybe, baby you will learn and change someday
