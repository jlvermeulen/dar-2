Bye bye, love.
Bye bye, happiness.
Hello, loneliness.
I think I`m a-gonna cry-y.

Bye bye, love.
Bye bye, sweet caress.
Hello, emptiness.
I feel like I could di-ie.
Bye bye, my love, goodby-ye.

There goes my baby
With-a someone new.
She sure looks happy.
I sure am blue.
She was my baby
`Til he stepped in.
Goodbye to romance
That might have been.

Bye bye, love.
Bye bye, happiness.

I`m a-through with romance.
I`m a-through with love.
I`m through with-a countin`
The stars above
And here`s reason
That I`m so free:
My lovin` baby
Is a-through with me.

Bye bye, love.
