Every night you go to bed crying. 
There's nothing left to do when love is dying. 
So before the whole world knows how we're hurtin, 
Don't you think it's time we pulled the curtains 

So many times I talked you out of leavin'. 
And so many times you've tried to fight the feeling. 
I guess we've tried and failed once too often. 
Now the suitcase down the hallway does the talking 

That just about does it, don't it, 
That'll just about kill it, won't it 
Maybe we should call a truce, 
We could but what's the use? 
That just about does it, don't it. 

It's sad to think that words could come between us. 
And what I said, God knows, I didn't mean it. 
It's time we realized this time it's over. 
It's tearing us apart to stay together. 

And that just about does it, don't it, 
That'll just about kill it, won't it 
Maybe we should call a truce, 
We could but what's the use? 
That just about does it, don't it. 

Maybe we should call a truce, 
We could but what's the use? 
That just about does it, don't it.
