You Better Not Do That (1954)
I'm just a plain ole country boy, and I like to do what's right
But just like any other boy, I like to hold em' tight
Sometimes I got resistance, but no matter how I try
When a cute little gal just looks at me, with a gleam in her eye

And I say, "you better not do that", and she said "why?” and I said
"Cause, you just better not do that"

When was in a country school, I always had a girl
That'd laugh and giggle all so cute, and put me in a whirl
And every day at recess time, she'd follow me outside 
I'd scratch my head and wonder, are they ever satisfied

And I’d say "honey, you better not do that", and she'd say "why", 
"Cause you just better not do that"

When I was a little older, I went to a country-dance
I went to have a little fun, wasn’t thinking about romance
But the dim lights just lured them on and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew that I wouldn’t last too long, cause I’m human, you see

I'd say "baby, you better not do that", and she'd say "why" and I say
"Cause, you just better not do that"

Now that's the way my life has been, ain’t it a crying shame
How much longer can I last, if I keep playing in the games?
Sometimes I don’t know who I am, don’t they know what they're doing
I'm afraid in days to come, girls will be my ruin

Now I say, "honey, you better not do that" and she'll say "why", and
I'll say well, "you just better not do that', and she'll still say "Why"
And I’ll say oh, well, oh, oh, it's alright to do that
