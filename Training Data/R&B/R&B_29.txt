Uhh
Dolla $ign
Mustard on the beat, ho

I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I'm just paranoid

Uh, I got a bad light skin from the valley
She be in the club with no panties
Lil' Bitch, she used to be my favorite
But now we don't speak the same language
I love my bitch, I could bang it
From my dark skin, at least know how to take dick
I got 'em both the same damn red bottoms
And bought 'em both the same damn fragrance
Both of my bitches drive Range Rovers
None of my bitches can stay over
Both of my bitches look good as fuck
Your bitch look like a boogawolf

I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I'm just paranoid

Yeah I'm paranoid, I'm tripping
I've been smoking and sipping
I'm fuckin' around with two bitches
But I never make them hoes my misses

Bobby!
Women talk, women talk
She run her mouth so much she can't hear her own thoughts
Told my old ho, she my new bitch
Told my new bitch, she my old ho
Well she used to be your ho
Dead, hold up, flat line
I fuck a bitch to sleep, nap time
I put my name on it and that's mine
Pussy so wet she thought it got baptized
Ask me where I'm at, that's a set-up
You ain't talking bout nothing, bitch shut up
If you got a side chick, nigga what up
Both my girls in the club bout to nut up
Stalking on my network
Got her looking so hard that her neck hurt
And I ain't tripping, I got room for 'em both
This is HAM Squad, I just doubled up my net worth

I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I'm just paranoid


Yeah I'm paranoid, I'm tripping
I've been smoking and sipping
I'm fuckin' around with two bitches
But I never make them hoes my misses
Yeah I'm paranoid, I'm tripping
I've been smoking and sipping
I'm fuckin' around with two bitches
But I never make them hoes my misses

I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I'm just paranoid
