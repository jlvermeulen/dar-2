I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it

Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain't a player, I just crush a lot

You give me that kinda something
Wanted all the time, needed everyday
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at 100
Never get enough, I can't stay away

If you want what I got it, I got it everyday
You can what a player need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care this is it babe
I don't want another way to feel you next to me

I love the way you make me feel
I love the way (I love the way)
Baby I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way, the way I love...

Oh, it's so crazy you get my heart jumping when you put your lips on mine
And honey it'a ... ain't a question, (q-question)
Boy I know just what you like

So if you need it what I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all there babe
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care this is it babe
I don't want another way to feel you next to me


I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way
(I love the way)
Baby I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way, the way I love you

Uh, I make it feel so fine, I make it feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feeling lonely, 
So you're sleeping in mine
You come and watch a movie with me, 
"American Beauty" or "Bruce Almighty" that groovy, 
Just come and move closer to me

But baby you're an adventure, so please let me come and explore you

So don't you worry, baby you got me

And I don't care this is it babe
I don't want another way to feel you next to me
