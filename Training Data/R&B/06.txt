Mama you remind me of something
But I don't know what it is
You remind me of something
You gotta show me

You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

Uh, on the real no lie
I don't know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right
B said put it to the left
Don't listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you ain't got no cares
We ain't leaving 'til there ain't no more left
Can't see no time on the Rolex
I can tell you a freak, go show it
Looking for the f'd up party, where to go at
Go on the floor like a doormat
Baby you know where to throw that
I said

Mama you remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me
You remind me of something
But I don't know what it is right now
You remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

Baby if you know what it is
On a real, can't lie, mean you just my type
Hands in the air like a frog right now
On a real, can't lie, mean you just my type

Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don't really care who you came with
Least you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex tried to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, ain't nowhere to land
You remind me of something missing
Misses, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the attention
If I get a minute, I'll put your bad ass in detention

Put your panties to the side
I'ma make you feel alright
'Cause I'ma give you what you need, yeah.
