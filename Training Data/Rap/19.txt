Show to her like Nina long
Use one she don’t need a loan
She start twirkin’ when she hear a song
Strip upon her income
We get trippy and then some
So nasty when she rollin’
She put that ass off in my hands, I remote control it
She give me dong when the roof down
After KOD she leave with me
She got friends, bring three
I got drugs, I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gon poke it like red paint
You say no to right your pussy, Juicy J can’t can’t ..
Racks erwer, the showin’ racks, I’m throwin’ racks
In the VIP, rub my ote, I’m stretching that
Rich niggas turp it, road niggas lookin’
And it ain’t a strip club if they showin’ pussy

Down in the lounge, ‘bout to hit a mansion
Throw some money into her, all the bad bitches gon credit
Straight off the floor, she gon need a couple of bags
Like a broke ATM, I’mma spillin’ all this cash
Them niggas in the club don’t be spendin’ shit
Twenty stacks in one night, I be on trippin’ shit
My crib’s paid off but I’m still payin’ rent
A couple of condoms paid, she love me ever since
She make that ass clap like she on a dick
Bring it back, I threw a stack, that’s a lucky bitch
Up and down she goin’, she slidin’ on that pole
Makin’ money, stackin’ them hunids, Shorty cold
