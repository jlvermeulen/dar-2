For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
My by any means on
Pardon I’m gettin’ my Scream on 
Enter the kingdom 
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in 
Came to see me in my black skin 
My homey was number one draft pick 
They still burned his jersey in Akron 
Fuck every question you askin'!]
If I don’t get ran out by Catholics 
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claimin’ I'm overreactin’
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the morning, and I’m zonin’
They say I’m possessed, it’s an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Picture me livin’ in the moment 
I’ve been a menace for the longest
Picture me livin’ in the moment
Picture me livin’ in the moment

So follow me up cause this shit’s about to go down
I’m doin’ 500, I’m outta control now
But there’s nowhere to go, now
And there’s no way to slow down
Runnin’ out of time – moving fast 
So just close your eyes and then enjoy this crash 

Four in the mornin’, and I’m zonin’
Think I’m possessed, it’s an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where’s the Trojans?
Baby we livin’ in the moment
I’ve been a menace for the longest
But I ain’t finished, I’m devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Stop all that 'coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I’m aware I’m a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I’m aware I’m a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room bitch
Stop all that 'coon shit
These niggas ain’t doin’ shit
Them niggas ain’t doin’ shit
What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard that’s rappin’
We might have to burn this whole suit down,
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in
[Alternate: Come on homie, what happened
You niggas ain't breathing, you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready, ready for action

Four in the mornin’, and I’m zonin’
Think I’m possessed, it’s an omen
300 girls, and we’re throwin’
300 girls, and they’re zonin’
Baby we’re livin’ in the moment
Baby we’re livin’ in the moment
keep it goin’
Keep it goin’, keep it goin’
