Hold me tight, let me go
Heal my heart, hurt my soul
Build me up, break me down
Make me smile, make me frown
Give me love, take it all away again
Give me love, take it all away again

Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me
Son of a mother studying at UDC
Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I weared are the American tee's
This whole system the most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys it's seldom you don't get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get the peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top


Give me love baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch baby
What the fuck baby, it's just us baby
This ain't right, this is life
This is love hate thing
Give me love baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch baby
What the fuck baby, it's just us baby
This ain't right, this is life
This is love hate thing

Hold me tight, let me go
Heal my heart, hurt my soul
Build me up, break me down
Make me smile, make me frown
Give me love, take it all away again
Give me love, take it all away again

Yeah, my affinity grows as the city gets cold
As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and a bigger soul
Women in town but I'm manifesting every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targeting our city in This Week
I lost a lot of friends, and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs
Lord father if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
How could you blame us envy?
We do the same thing for a living
Know the same niggas but they all commend me
Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
Probably not but I'm temporary out of fizux
AND TELL THE POST TO LEAVE propaganda TO politicians

Hold me tight, let me go
Heal my heart, hurt my soul
Build me up, break me down
Make me smile, make me frown
Give me love, take it all away again
Give me love, take it all away again
