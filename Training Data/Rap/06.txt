Yeah baby, heh heh, yeah
Back again, that's right, Luda, ha, ha, ha, ha, feel this
It gets meaner and meaner each time, baby
Feelin' real good too, holla at 'em, man, what up Uncle 'Face? Yeah

I'm a bull in this industry man, tell 'em
Some would rather run down and get one cow
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout right? Look

I'm never goin' nowhere, so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like ivy, oh, they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me

Respected highly, hi Mr. O'Reilly
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me

I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes

Explorer like Dora, these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin' harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me

Whoa, don't slip up or get got, why not man?
I'm comin' for that number one spot, alright
Rappers swearin' they on top, nuh uh, uh uh
But I'm comin' for they number one spot, alright man

Scheme, scheme, plot, plot, say what?
I'm comin' for that number one spot, woo, hey
Keep it goin', it won't stop, what you doin' man?
I'm comin' for that number one spot

Yes indeed, Ludacris, I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po', I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha

Father, father, and hey, I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled

A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop, once a year for my fans' sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight

The Luda-meister got 'em feelin' so randy
I'm double XL so I call 'em my 'Eye Candy'
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

Whoa, don't slip up or get got, why not man?
I'm comin' for that number one spot, alright
Rappers swearin' they on top, nuh uh, uh uh
But I'm comin' for they number one spot, alright man

Scheme, scheme, plot, plot, say what?
I'm comin' for that number one spot, woo, hey
Keep it goin', it won't stop, what you doin' man?
I'm comin' for that number one spot

Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin' to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly"

Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin' like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world

Whoa, don't slip up or get got, why not man?
I'm comin' for that number one spot, alright
Rappers swearin' they on top, nuh uh, uh uh
But I'm comin' for they number one spot, alright man

Scheme, scheme, plot, plot, say what?
I'm comin' for that number one spot, woo, hey
Keep it goin', it won't stop, what you doin' man?
I'm comin' for that number one spot
