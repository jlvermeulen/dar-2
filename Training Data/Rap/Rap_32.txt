Stay down with my day one niggas, and we in the club screaming
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new (DJ Khaled)
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new

No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new

Smoke good I love life, strip club like every night
Every night my same niggas day one straight menace
