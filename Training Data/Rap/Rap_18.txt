Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin'
Racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team
I should join the league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin
I fuck her once, don't call her
My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again

Got so much money I got racks on racks on racks on racks on racks
Bitch so much money my shit stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks
you see me smokin' and you know I got that pack, I got that sack
I got that O, I hit the club I lose control
I smoke that loud
I know the grower, ball like the owner
Hits this gym make things move slower
I'm never sober, roll some weed or eyes gets lower
I'm in my old school ride it sounds just like a new remoter
They're wondering how I get these mills,
And still live like a stoner, no other way
I get a 100k from each promoter or more than that
Hold up money, long it don't fall out,
Let me get some gin pour up, got some fun weed roll up,
Niggas got their gang thrown' up
These niggas got their game, they got it from us
I'm with my gang and my niggas go nuts
You talkin' money best believe I show up
And all the real niggas know us


Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin'
Racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team
I should join the league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin
I fuck her once, don't call her
My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again


Talkin' money but walkin' funny, is it any reason ya'll starvin'
I spell bull and by spelling force
Do I really need to bag your part?
And my jersey say James I don't play games,
Like Bron when he in that Garden
And, wait I said that all wrong,
She don't need to rock when I put my hard in
My new nickname is just watch
Might not join might just watch
New yacht master just a watch
Doubten me I tell em just watch
Them diamonds yellow them beams are red
and them hands are tucked they dont show
Plus them shooters with me got the green light
So why the fuck you don't think they wont go?
Hold up, your chick traded post game
and no shame she felt your man
She probably on Joe Johnson
Cause I never be on that Elton Brand
It's YSL, she's fly as hell
Tell the come to go to my ride
You cant blame hoes aint Peter Rose
Now she a thorne in my side
Grow up, P-R-P-S is over my Timbs
Way shorty blew me at it was only right I showed her my bench
Let my millions hit, when the fan hit
Spend all these bills on liquor
Fricken Jersey love is team
Still we got the realest niggas Joey


Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin'
Racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team
I should join the league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin
I fuck her once, don't call her
My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again

 
Keep a bad bitch on my team
Got bout 5 ounce of that lean
My chain blue-ray on that screen
I spent two days countin that cream
Got bout five acres on my doorway
Your main bitch is my throw away
Got bout eight whips they brainless
My main bitch like shorty
Got my top down her hair out
Isolate and she clear out
Fast break my bread straight
One hand shake and I bail out
Hit streets corner bitches callin tell em break friend
Derrick Rose ballin bitch never goin broke again
..my shades
Clear ice they skate
Lebron James on that break
Real estate with that lake
Shootin from half court got you by a long shot
Montana, that nigga from the Bronx block


Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin'
Racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team
I should join the league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin
I fuck her once, don't call her
My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
