I'm a get arrogant, fuck it
Watch 60,000 either you hate it, you love it
This for them nights serving crack out the bucket
Out on that corner that Kirby, no Puckett
Pull up the car, got them dropping they jaws
Pull out the chain, got them dropping they drawers
Pull out some money, she doing a dance
Shit, all this money can't fit in my pants
She got a thing for them ballers for sure
And in the bedroom she model them clothes
Money, my nigga, yeah, all of us get it

Mercilago, no mercy on suckers
Let's go to war, just me versus you busters
Money gang, all my virgins in colors
Versace red while I'm twerking the clutch
Swerving like I had too much to drink
I think Chevy passed me that duby that had that oochy, that Gucci for broke niggas
That's what I screamed out the roof of that thing
Popping Gucci, Gucci and my crew just to provoke niggas
Damn right, tears with me, get my hand right
So I had to go ham, play my hand, hand in hand
With the grams till a nigga got his plan right
You ain't playing right, see, a nigga like you can't stand life
We were Instagraming all damn night
In the club we gonna run up on you man like

Rich niggas in this motherfucker
All you broke niggas exit now
Bitch niggas in this motherfucker
