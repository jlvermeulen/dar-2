Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong,
Under the shade of a Coolibah tree,
He sang as he watched and waited till his billy boil,
"You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."

"Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boil,
"You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."

Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong;
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee,
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag,
"You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."

"Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boil,
"You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."

Up rode the squatter mounted on his thoroughbred;
Up rode the troopers: one, two, three:
"Whose that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."

"Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me.
With that jolly jumbuck that you've got in your tucker bag,
You'll come a Waltzing, you scoundrel, with me."

Up jumped the swagman, sprang into the billabong:
"You'll never take me alive," said he.
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong -
"You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."

"Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."
His ghost may be heard as you pass by the billabong -
"You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me."
