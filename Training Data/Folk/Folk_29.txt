I've been a wild rover for many's the year
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer,
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more,

And it's No, Nay, never,
No, nay never no more,
Will I play the wild rover,
No never no more.

I went in to an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay. Such a customer as you I can have any day."

And it's No, Nay, never,
No, nay never no more,
Will I play the wild rover,
No never no more.

I took up from my pocket, ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.
She says "I have whiskeys and wines of the best
And the words that you told me were only in jest,"

And it's No, Nay, never,
No, nay never no more,
Will I play the wild rover,
No never no more.

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son,
And, when they've caressed me as oft times before
I never will play the wild rover no more,

And it's No, Nay, never,
No, nay never no more,
Will I play the wild rover,
No never no more.
