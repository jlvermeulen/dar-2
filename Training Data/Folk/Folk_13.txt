Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight,
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.

Last Saturday night I got married.
Me and my wife settled down.
Now me and my wife are parted,
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown

Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight,
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.

Sometimes I live in the country;
Sometimes I live in town;
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump into the river and drown

Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight,
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.

Stop ramblin', stop your gamblin';
Stop stayin' out late at night;
Go home to your wife and family -
Stay there by your farsight right.

Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight,
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.

Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight,
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.
