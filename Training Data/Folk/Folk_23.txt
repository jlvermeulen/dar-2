Are you going to Sacrborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
Remember me to one who lives there,
She once was a true love of mine.

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
Without any seems, nor needlework,
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

Tell her to find me an acre of land,
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
Between the salt water and the sea strand,
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

Tell her to plough it with a sickle of leather.
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
And bind it all in a bunch of heather,
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
