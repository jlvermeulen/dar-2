Once I lived the life of a millionaire,
Spending money, didn't have any care,
I took my friends out for a mighty good time,
Bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine.

Then I began to fall so low,
I didn't have a friend, and no place to go
If I get my hand on a dollar again,
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagles grin.

Nobody knows you when you're down and out,
In your pocket not one penny,
And as for friends, you haven't any;
But when you get back on your feet again,
Everybody wants to be your long lost friend,
It's mighty strange, without any doubt,
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.

Nobody knows you when you're down and out,
In your pocket not one penny,
And as for friends, you haven't any;
But when you get back on your feet again,
Everybody wants to be your long lost friend,
It's mighty strange, without any doubt,
Nobody knows you,
Nobody knows you,
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.
