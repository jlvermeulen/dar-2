O when the Saints go marching in
When the Saints go marching in
I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in

And when the sun begins to shine
And when the sun begins to shine
I want to be in that number
When the sun begins to shine

When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
I want to be in that number
When the moon turns red with blood

On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
I want to be in that number
On that hallelujah day

O when the trumpet sounds the call
O when the trumpet sounds the call
O Lord, I want to be in that number
When the trumpet sounds the call

O when the Saints go marching in
When the Saints go marching in
I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
