There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And Lord I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor.
She sowed my new blue jeans.
My father was a gambling man,
Down in New Orleans.

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk,
And the only time he is satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk.

So mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
And live your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.

I've got one foot on the platform;
The other is on the train,
And I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain.

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And Lord I know I'm one.
