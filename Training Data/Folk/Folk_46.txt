Corrina, Corrina
Where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Where you been so long?
Been worryin' about you baby.
Girl, please come home.

Corrina, Corrina
Girl you're on my mind.
Corrina, Corrina
Girl you're on my mind.
Thinkin' about you baby.
I just can't keep from crying.

Corrina, Corrina
Where'd you stay last night?
Corrina, Corrina
Where'd you stay last night?
You come home this mornin',
Your clothes don't fit you right.

Got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
Got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
But without Corrina
Life don't mean a thing.
