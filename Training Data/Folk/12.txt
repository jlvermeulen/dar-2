He's five feet two
And he's six feet four
He fights with missiles and with spears
He's all of 31
And he's only 17
He's been a soldier for a thousand years

He's a Catholic
A Hindu
An atheist
A Jain
a Buddhist
And a Baptist
And a Jew
And he knows he shouldn't kill
And he knows he always will kill you for me, my friend, and me for you

And he's fighting for Canada
He's fighting for France
He's fighting for the USA
And he's fighting for the Russians and he's fighting for Japan
And he thinks we'll put an end to war this way

And he's fighting for Democracy
He's fighting for the Reds
He says it's for the peace of all
He's the one who must decide
Who's to live and who's to die
And he never sees the writing on the walls

But without him
How would Hitler have condemned him
At Dachau
Without him
Caesar would have stood alone
He's the one who gives his body as a weapon to the war
And without him all this killing can't go on

He's the universal soldier
And he really is to blame
But his orders come from far away no more
They come from him
And you and me
And brothers, can't you see
This is not the way we put an end to war?
