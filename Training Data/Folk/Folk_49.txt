O wither away my bonny maid
So late and so far in the gloaming?
The mist gathers grey on moorland and brae;
O wither so far are you roaming?

O you take the high road and I'll take the low;
I'll be in Scotland before you,
For me and my true love will never meet again
By the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond.

I trusted my own love last night in the broom,
My Donald who loves me so dearly;
For the morrow he will march for Edinburugh town
To fight for his king and Prince Charlie.

O well may I weep for yestreen in my sleep -
We stood bride and bridegroom together;
But his arms and his breath were as cold as the death,
And his heart's blood ran red in the heather.

O you take the high road and I'll take the low;
I'll be in Scotland before you,
For me and my true love will never meet again
By the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond.

As dauntless in battle as tender in love,
He'd yield never a foot to the foeman;
But never again frae the field of the slain
To his Moira will he come by Loch Lomond.

The thistle may bloom, the king hae his own,
And fond lovers meeting in the gloaming;
And me and my true love will lyet meet again
Far above the bonny banks of Loch Lomond.

O you take the high road and I'll take the low;
I'll be in Scotland before you,
For me and my true love will never meet again
By the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond.
