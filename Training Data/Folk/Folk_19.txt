Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I look for you if I'm ever back this way
Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that
A hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I look for you if I'm ever back this way
