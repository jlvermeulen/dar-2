As I was a goin' over the far-famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting.
I first produced me pistol and I then produced me rapier,
Saying, "Stand and deliver for you are a bold deceiver."

Ringum, doorum-a-da,
Whack fol my daddy O,
Whack fol my daddy O,
There's whiskey in the jar.

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Ringum, doorum-a-da,
Whack fol my daddy O,
Whack fol my daddy O,
There's whiskey in the jar.

I went into my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
Jenny took me pistol.  She filled it up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter.

Ringum, doorum-a-da,
Whack fol my daddy O,
Whack fol my daddy O,
There's whiskey in the jar.

'twas early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of coopers and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for me rapier she had stolen
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

Ringum, doorum-a-da,
Whack fol my daddy O,
Whack fol my daddy O,
There's whiskey in the jar.

If there's anyone can aid me 'tis my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
If he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny
I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

Ringum, doorum-a-da,
Whack fol my daddy O,
Whack fol my daddy O,
There's whiskey in the jar.

There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
And others take delight in the hurling and the bowling,
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

Ringum, doorum-a-da,
Whack fol my daddy O,
Whack fol my daddy O,
There's whiskey in the jar.
