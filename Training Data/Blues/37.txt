Well, everyday I work
Bringin' home my pay
Come to find out, baby
Youve given my money away

Tell me, baby
What you tryin to do?
You aint seen me hummin
Like you used to do

Tell me, mama
Whats wrong with you?
You know, pretty baby
Im so crazy bout you
[Incomprehensible]

All you pretty women
Bring it to my home
You dont have to worry
I wont do you no wrong

Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome

Look here, pretty baby
This mess I wont stand
All the other women
Say you got another man

Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
