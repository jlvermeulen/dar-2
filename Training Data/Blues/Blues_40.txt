Now here's a story about
A great big old giant
Ooh!
My money
My honey
And me

I been digging all those stories about the West the cats have told
Me and my baby cut out there, dig us up a mess of gold
The minute we find a buried treasure, I looked up and see
A great big old eight-foot giant looking dead on me

And that dood it, you know, and that dood it
I didn't have no more eyes for digging up no more gold
No, no, no, no, no, no!

I grabbed what I had in one hand and my baby by the other
A giant grabbed my coattail and said, "Don't you go another further"
I ripped off my coat when I was shaking the scene
But what really got my goat was when I heard my baby scream

An'd that dood it, ooh-wee! And that dood it
Because I am not going nowhere, and leave my baby there
No, no, no, no, no, no!

I put on my brakes and stopped dead in my tracks
As much as I hated the idea, I went crawling on back
I said, "Look-a here, Mister Giant," as I raised slowly on one knee
"I'll do anything you say. Hand my baby to me."

And that dood it, mm-hmm, and that dood it
He said, "You bust that loose, and I'll set your baby free."
No, no, no, no, no, no!


I said, "I'll make you a proposition. It's up to you to choose
It's either your money or your honey. One of the two you'll have to lose."
I said, "Mister Giant, I want to thank you for taking a load off my mind
But when it come to choosin' between my money—and my honey
I take my money—what I'm sayin'?—I mean my honey everytime."

And that dood it, you know, and that dood it
Now the giant got the money and I got my honey, and everybody's feeling fine
No, no, no, no, no, no!
