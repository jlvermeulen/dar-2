you better come on
in my kitchen
well, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
a woman i know
took my best friend
some joker got lucky
stole her back again
he better come on
in my kitchen
it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
well she's gone
i know she won't come back
i took the last nickel
out of her nation sack
you better come on
in my kitchen
well, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

yeah can't you hear that wind how;?
you can hear it now

you better come on
in my kitchen
'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

oh when a woman gets in trouble
everybody throws her down
lookin' for a good friend
but none cane be found

you better come on
in my kitchen
babe it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
