Oh, no matter what you say, baby
No matter what you do
The way youve been treating me woman
Is coming back home to you

And your crying wont help you, woman
Oh, crying wont help you, baby
Oh, crying wont help you, woman
Cause youve been so mean to me

Oh, you must remember, baby
No matter where you go
Watch those seeds just scatter, woman
Because youre gonna reap just what you sow

And your crying wont help you, woman
Oh, crying wont help you now
Oh, crying wont help you, baby
Cause you been so mean to me

Oh, the way youve been treating me woman
Just cant understand
Oh, Im gonna leave you woman
Let you do the best you can

And your crying wont help you, woman
Oh, crying wont help you now
Oh, crying wont help you, woman
Cause you been so mean to me, look out

Oh, just before I leave you woman
Just before I shake your hand
Im gonna get me a woman, baby
Not to get you mad

And your crying wont help you, woman
Oh, crying wont help you now
Oh, crying wont help you, baby
Cause you been so mean to me
