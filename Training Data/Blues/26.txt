If I was wrong darling I didn't know, please help me to
understand
Teach me how to love you, hold on to my trembling
hand
Walk right here beside me, my whole life through
Teach me how to love you, that's all I want you to do
And in return for your love, I swear I'll be true
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy, crazy about you baby,
so teach me how to love you
Walk right here beside, my whole life through
Teach me how to love you, that's all I want you to do
And in return for your love, I swear I'll be true
Yeah, I'm crazy, crazy, crazy about you baby,
so teach me how to love you
Oh yeah
