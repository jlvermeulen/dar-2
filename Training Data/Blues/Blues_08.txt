I got to keep movin'

I got to keep movin'
Blues fallin' down like hail
Blues fallin' down like hail

Umm mmm mmm mmm

blues fallin' down like hail
Blues fallin' down like hail

And the days keeps on worryin' me

there's a hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail

If today was Christmas Eve

If today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day

If today was Christmas Eve

and tomorrow was Christmas Day
Spoken: Aow, wouldn't we have a time, baby?

All I would need my little sweet rider just

to pass the time away, huh huh
To pass the time away

You sprinkled hot foot powder, mmm

mmm, around my door
All around my door

You sprinkled hot foot powder

All around your daddy's door, hmm hmm hmm

It keep me with ramblin' mind, rider

Every old place I go
Every old place I go

I can tell the wind is risin'

The leaves tremblin' on the tree
Tremblin' on the tree

I can tell the wind is risin'

Leaves tremblin' on the tree
Hmm hmm hmm mmm

All I need's my little sweet woman

And to keep my company, hey hey hey hey
My company
