Well, you can send me a telegram,
call me on the phone
I jump on the highest mountain,
before I let you come back home
You've got bad intentions baby,
woman, you ain't got the right thing to mine
Yeah, you left me for the last time,
woman, you know I ain't lyin'
Well, you can make my front bell,
knock on my back door
Don't come in this house,
'cause you don't live here no more
You've got bad intentions baby,
woman, you ain't got the right thing to mine
Yeah, you left me for the last time,
woman, you know I ain't lyin'
You can holler, cry and scream,
till your face turn blue
Get on your knees and crawl,
woman, that won't help you
You've got bad intentions baby,
woman, you ain't got the right thing to mine
Yeah
Well, you say you can't go on living,
if you can't be by my side
Gonna send you a bottle of poison,
please commit suicide
You've got bad intentions baby,
woman, you ain't got the right thing to mine
