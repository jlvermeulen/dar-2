Why did it happen this way
someone has taken my place
you want to share my embrace
why do you do me like you do

i give my heart to you
Like noone never do
im just so lonely and blue
why do you do me like you do

way down inside me
there is noone after for you
deep down inside me
there is noone after you

i give my heart to you
like noone ever could do
im just so lonely and blue
why do you do me like you do

way down inside me
where's noone else but you
deep down inside me
there noone else but you

i give my hear to you
like noone else could do
im just so lonely and blue
why do you do me like you do
