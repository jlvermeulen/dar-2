I’m gonna call it, just like I see it
I’m gonna state my case, as I live and breathe it
Stop for a while, want a conversation
I swear you’re gonna like it
I stake my reputation

I’m starting to fall in love with you
What am I supposed to do
Don’t hold back, let’s see this through

Chorus:
I can feel it all begin
And it makes me wanna sing ooh ooh 
Joy and laughter all the way
Baby I just gotta say, ooh baby
I’m a fool for you baby, I’m just a fool..

Can’t believe it, you knock me off my feet
A little bit of dynamite, when you turn up the heat 
Destination , unknown
I’m on a trip with you, I’ll go down any road
I don’t know where we’re going
Well that alright with me 
I’ll follow you on this journey

Love came knocking on my door for sure
Not giving it up, giving up, giving it up no baby
I might be a fool but who care I’m in love…
I’m in love tell the world
