Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey made me lose my happy home

When I left home this morning
I promised I would think
to stay real straight and sober
I swore I wouldn't drink

Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey made me lose my happy home

I passed up all the Pool halls
Gave the boys a slip
Before the night was over
I started in to sip

Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey made me lose my happy home

My buddy had a party
The cats were on the loose
We started out with soda
And ended up all juiced

Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey made me lose my happy home

My baby's gone and left me
Man I feel so sad
Because the blues have got me
And I've sure got them bad

Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey
Bad Bad Whiskey made me lose my happy home
Made me lose my happy home
Made me lose my happy home
