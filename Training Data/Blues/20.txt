Hello, little school girl
Good morning, little school girl
Can I go home with you?
Can I go home, later wit' you?

Now, you can tell yo' mother an' yo' father, mm
That Sonny Boy's a little school boy, too

I woke up this morning
I woke up this morning
Lord, and I couldn't make me no
Lord, I couldn't make me, no town

Well, said I didn't have no blues, woman
But I was all messed up, anyhow

Now, you be my baby, mm
Come on an' be my baby, mm
I'll buy you a diamond
I'll buy you a diamond ring

Well, if you don't be my little woman
Then I won't buy you a doggone thing

I'm gonna buy me a airplane
I'm gonna buy me a airplane
I'm gonna fly all over this land
I'm gonna fly all over this land's town

Don't find the woman that I'm lovin'
Then I ain't goin' to let my airplane down

I do no hollerin'
I do no hollerin'
Baby, what in this world I'm gonna do
Baby, what in this world I'm gonna do

Well, that I don't want never hurt yo' feelin'
Or either get mad at you
