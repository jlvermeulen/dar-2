Yes, I'm goin' away, baby
With you on my mind
Yes, I'm goin' away, baby
With you on my mind

You cheat me but I didn't bother
Trouble all the time

Yes, I never loved but
Four women in my life
Yes, I never loved but
Four women in my life

They're my mommy and my sister
Sweetheart and my wine

He's sayin' you don't want me
Please, don't dog me 'round
Just like you found me, baby
You can put me down

I said goodbye, baby
And you called that dog
I said goodbye, baby
And you called that dog

You can't leave me now
You be comin' back
