I spell, B-A-D

I'm bad

That mean no messin' me


Now, all you women

Remember when I was twenty-one?

That was a year, baby

That I had a-lots of fun


But a year has gone by

I'm now, twenty-two

I can eat nails, honey

And drink gun powder soup


I spell B-A-D

I'm bad

Don't mess with me


Now, honey you better tell yo' husband

Quit sneakin', peepin', at me

He wanna fight off the man

That I'm the s'posed to be


I'll make sure the drill's runnin'

And mess up his face

I'll even try to snatch bof'a

His legs outta place


B-A-D, bad

One mo' question, honey

Before I start to studder

I can even tell you why

White milk make yellow butter


I'm B-A-D, bad


You ask me, honey

What it was all about

Ya even asked me where the light went

When it went out


I'm B-A-D

I'm bad

Don't mess with me


All, all, all, all


All, all, all, all


Wah-hoo!
