Yeah, I got a boogie woogie woman
Boogie woogie all the time
Yeah, I got a boogie woogie woman
She boogie all the time
If she keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies all night long
Yes, and the mornin' come
She's still goin' strong, alright

Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, she boogies in the mornin'
And she boogies late at night
Well, I don't mind her boogyin'
'Cause her boogyin' is alright

Well, she's a bogie woogie woman
And she boogies all the time
Well, she's a bogie woogie woman
She boogies all the time
Well, if keep on boogyin'
She bound to lose her mind
