Wake up mama, turn your lamp down low.
Have you got the nerve to drive poor papa Taj from your door?

Woke up this mornin' baby, I had them statesboro blues.
Statesboro Georgia, that is.
Woke up this mornin, had them statesboro blues.
Looked over in the corner, well my baby had 'em too.

Mama died and left me reckless, Papa died and left me wild,
I ain't good lookin baby, but I'm someone's sweet angel child.
Going to the country, baby do you want to go?
I know if you can't make it, your sister Lucille say she won't go.

You know I loved that woman better than any woman I'd ever seen.
Yes I loved that woman better than any woman I'd ever seen.
She treat me like a king, I treat her like she was a doggone Queen.

wake up mama, turn your lamp down low.
