Well I was standin' at the track, waitin' for the train
to go by
Well I was standin' at the track, waitin' for the
train to go by
Well I was thinkin' 'bout my baby, all I could do was
cry
Well the train passed by, the whistle didn't even
blow
Well the train passed by, the whistle didn't even
blow
Well I was waitin' for my baby, she didn't even show
Oooh!
Well the train passed by, the whistle didn't even
blow
Well the train passed by, the whistle didn't even
blow
Well I was waitin' for my baby, she didn't even show
Well you don't know how it feels, man, to be alone
Well you don't know how it feels, man, to be alone
Well unless you had my baby, fall in love and she had
gone
