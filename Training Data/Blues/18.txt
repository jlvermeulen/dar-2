Lord I say good morning Mr pawnshop man : as I walked in
his door
I says I feel bad this morning : and I really wants my
forty-four

Lord I was at a party last night : I was out there till
about half past two
I'm going back out there tonight : I'm out to have some
shooting to do

Lord the policeman walked around me : they walked around
me both night and day
When they know I got my fortyâ€‘four : they won't have a
word to say

Then I made up in my mind : and I [really, simply] don't
care how I go
Before I'll be mistreated : I'm going to shoot my
forty-four
