Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
You say I've been spendin' my money on other woman
But you've been runin' with somebody else

I called your mama, 'bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama, 'bout three or four nights ago
Well your mother said, "Son don't call my daughter no more"

Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Well now you say I've been runin' around
But you've got somebody else

Come on back home baby try my love one more time
Come on back home baby try my love one more time
Well now you've been gone away so long
I'm gonna lose my mind

Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Oh before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Well now you say I've been buyin' another woman clothes
You've been takin' money from somebody else
