While we are living in this world of care
Many the burdens that we have to bear
But there's a prayer bell at the Lord's right hand
Give it a ring and He will understand

Prayer bells of heaven oh how sweetly they ring
Bearing a message unto Jesus our king
When you are burdened down with sorrows and care
Ring on and on for God will answer your prayer

Three Hebrew children to the fire were thrown
Because a worldly king they would not own
Jesus delivered and the king then saw
Prayer bells of heaven beat a man made law

When Paul and Silas were thrown into jail
They didn't worry who would go their bail
But on the prayer bells they began to ring
Off fell the stocks and they begin to sing

Into the garden Jesus went to pray
Until His sweat became as blood they say
Ringing the prayer bells there in agony
Bringing salvation that we might be free
