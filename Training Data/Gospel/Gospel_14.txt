We are on the sea of life
Sailing to a better home
Where the saved of all the earth shall abide
Leaving all our trials here, many pleasures wait us there
When we cross the foam and reach the other side

We are sailing onward, sailing, sailing over the foam
We are talking to the captain as the angry billows hum
Soon, yes soon, we'll reach the harbour and be safely over the tide
We are going onward to the other side

Many millions now abide in that home beyond the tide
Where the ransomed pilgrims wait free from care
There is room on board for all who will hear the captains call
And take ship for heaven's country bright and fair
