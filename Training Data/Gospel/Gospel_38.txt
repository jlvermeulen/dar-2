Life gets tough and times get hard
And it's hard to find the truth in all the lies
If you're tired of wondering why you're heart isn't healing
And nothing feels like home cause you're lost and alone
Just screaming at the sky 

When you don't know what to say
Just say Jesus
There is power in the name
The name of Jesus
If the words won't come cause you're too afraid to pray
Just say Jesus

Whisper it now, or shout it out
However it comes out, He hears your cry
Out of nowhere He will come
You gotta believe it
He will rescue you
Just call out to the way, the truth, the life

When you don't know what to say
Just say Jesus
There is power in the name
The name of Jesus
If the words won't come cause you're too afraid to pray
There is just one name, strong enough to save
There is just one name
There is just one name
Jesus

When you don't know what to say
Just say Jesus
There's still power in the name
The name of Jesus
If the words won't come cause you're too afraid to pray
If the words won't come and you don't know what to say
Just say Jesus
