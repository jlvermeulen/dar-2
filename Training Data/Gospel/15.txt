I was standing by the bedside of a neighbor
Who was just about to cross a swellin' tide
And I asked him if he would do me a favor
Kindly take this message to the other side

Well if you see him tell him that you saw me
When you saw me I was on my way
You may meet some more friends who may ask about me
But tell'em I am comin' home some day

Well, you have to make this journey on without me
Sooner or later sooner or later it's a debt that must be paid
When you reach that goal it's when you think about me
But don't forget to tell my Savior what I say

You may chance to meet my mother and my father
Or some friend that I can't recall
You may chance to meet my brother and my father
But don't forget to see my Savior first of all

I was standing by the bedside of a neighbor
Who was just about to cross a swellin' tide
And I asked him if he would do me a favor
