I made my castle tall
I built up every wall
This is my kingdom and it needs to fall
I want you and no one else
Empty me of myself
Until the only thing that’s left is

More of You
Less of me
Make me who I’m meant to be
You’re all I want all I need
You’re everything
Take it all I surrender
Be my king
Yeah I choose
More of You and Less of me
I need more of you
More of you

This life I hold so close
Oh, God I let it go
I refuse to gain the world and lose my soul
So take it all I abandon everything I am
You can have it
The only thing I need is

More of You
Less of me
Make me who I’m meant to be
You’re all I want all I need
You’re everything
Take it all I surrender
Be my king
Yeah I choose
More of You and Less of me
I need more of you
More of you

All to You
I surrender
All to You my blessed savior
I surrender all

All to You
I surrender
All to You my blessed savior
I surrender all

More of You
Less of me
Make me who I’m meant to be
You’re all I want all I need
You’re everything
Take it all I surrender
Be my king
Yeah I choose
More of You and Less of me
I need more of you
More of you

All to You
I surrender
All to You my blessed savior

More of you
I need more of you
