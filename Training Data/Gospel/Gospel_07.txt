One, two, three, four
Get my shoes and out the door
Five, I’m alive
Six, seven, eight, feeling great
Nine, gonna shine, life is good, I’m doing fine
Ten, gonna do it right and do it again

Ya, I look into the sky with all it’s beautiful colour
But there’s more than just for me, so gonna share it with another

I got
To show, to give, let out
I want
To sing and shout
Take a look and see a

Beautiful morning
That turns into a
Beautiful evening
And together make a
Beautiful life

And if you want to see
Then come along me
That’s right

And if you want a good tomorrow
It’s pretty simple, gotta find the light to follow
And if you do you’ll have a future real bright

It’s a combination of consistency
Come on and sing

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

With another sun rise
It’s a brand new day
So gonna make a little list
To keep the worries away

I gotta dance just a little bit
Move to be free
Keep my head up high
Don’t forget to be me

Like I won a million dollars
Like I hit the pay dirt
Smile a smile from ear to ear
The kind that make your face hurt

Gonna laugh, jump, sing loud
Not afraid to shout about
Being happy, living it out

Take a look and see a

Beautiful morning
That turns into a
Beautiful evening
And together make a
Beautiful life

And if you want to see
Then come along me
That’s right

And if you want a good tomorrow
It’s pretty simple, gotta find the light to follow
And if you do you’ll have a future real bright

It’s a combination of consistency
Come on and sing

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
