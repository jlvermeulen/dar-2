Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the ragin' storm
Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will bear the spirit home.

Come on, brothers and sisters, and don't fall asleep
Pray night and day or you'll sleep in the deep
Now fathers and mothers are prayin' so loud
Said : ‘Lord, won't you take us in your lifeboat ?’

Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the ragin' storm
Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will bear the spirit home.

Clouds are so heavy, the winds are so loud
Thunder is rolling beckoning the crowd
They pray for the shipmates for what they have done
They took the dyin' sailor in their lifeboat.

Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the ragin' storm
Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will bear the spirit home.

Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the ragin' storm
Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will bear the spirit home.
