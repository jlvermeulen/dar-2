I Can Only Imagine
For my salvation
Will not be tainted so I rebuke temptation
I imagine good things because the only good is God
Staying away from Satan because he makes it hard

Hard like a rock but nothing like Jesus
Keeping the Holy Ghost
Satan shaking Satan like a seizure

With Jehovah on my mind my burdens always light
There's no darkness in my Father that's why I keep clear site

Repented for my sins
Even though I imagine
So the devourer is rebuked and in my land there's no famine

Christ said you think it
You already done it like premeditated murder
But the real blood is coming

Judging without a mallet but the power still in his hands
Delivering us from the world
Quicker than that check from the mailman

I imagine what it's like when I meet my loved ones
Because I asked God to forgive them in the name of His son

I Can Only Imagine
