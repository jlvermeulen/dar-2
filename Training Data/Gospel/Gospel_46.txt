Lived so long with my eyes on me
Too deaf to hear, too blind to see
Oh, broken hearts on the city streets but
I can hear that you’re calling me to
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Oh, you put my life in motion
Your love makes me want to give my all
Ready set go
Ready set go oh
So no, I’m not holding back anymore
Like an engine ready to explode
I’m ready set go
Ready set go oh, oh

Can’t stop this clock is counting down, go down
So many lost waiting to be found, oh yeah
I would go where you’re leading me, God
Reach my hands to the least of these
I'll be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Oh, you put my life in motion
Your love makes me want to give my all
Ready set go
Ready set go oh
So no, I’m not holding back anymore
Like an engine ready to explode
I’m ready set go
Ready set go oh, oh

Give me the green light
Show me the finish line
No more spinning in circles
No more wasting time
So let it start today, where I flip the switch say
You're my light, I won't fight, I'll go wherever you say
To the top of the highest mountain
To the bottom of every valley
I'll be the spark that turns into the grand finale
This love is something everyone needs to know
Hearts are callin', no more stalling, it's just
Ready set go

Broken hearts on the city streets but
I can hear that you’re calling me to
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Oh, you put my life in motion
Your love makes me want to give my all
Ready set go
Ready set go oh
So no, I’m not holding back anymore
Like an engine ready to explode
I’m ready set go
Ready set go oh, oh
