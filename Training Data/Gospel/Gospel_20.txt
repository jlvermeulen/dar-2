I read about a man one day
He wasted not his time away
He prayed to God
Every morning noon and night
He cared not for the things avail
But trusted one who never fails
Oh, Daniel prayed
Each morning, noon and night

Oh Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh Daniel prayed every morning, noon and night

They locked him in the lions den
Because he could not honor men
But he prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night
The jaws were locked, it made him shout
And god soon brought him safely out
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night

Oh Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh Daniel prayed every morning, noon and night

Now brother let us watch and pray
Like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night
We too can gladly dare and do
And pray to God he'll see us through
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night

Oh Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh Daniel prayed every morning, noon and night
