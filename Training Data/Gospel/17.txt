When I close my eyes in death,
Fold my hands across my chest.
Sing for me a pretty song
While I take my journey home.

Not afraid to bid this world good-bye.
Not afraid to close my eyes and die.
For His courage I have prayed.
In His arms I'm not afraid.

When I cross that silent sea
And those home lights beckon me.
I'll feel no pain, I'll fear no harm.
Safe, secure in Jesus' arms.

Not afraid to bid this world good-bye.
Not afraid to close my eyes and die.
For His courage I have prayed.
In His arms I'm not afraid.
