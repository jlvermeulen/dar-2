Oh my brother take this warning
Don't let ol Satan take your hand
You'll be lost in sin forever
You'll never reach the promised land

The old crossroads now is waiting
Which one are you going to take
One leads down to destruction
The other to the pearly gate

One road leads up to heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus our savior will protect you
He'll guide you through the old crossroads

Soon your life will be over
You'll have to face the old crossroads
Will you be ready then my brother
To shun the one down below
