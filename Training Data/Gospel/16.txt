All around the world I've traveled, Through it all
I've come to find. The ties that bind, can come
unraveled. I've had to face some lonely times. But
when I am tired, and feeling low, Oh what a comfort it
is to know.

Across the miles, There's someone praying for me.
Across the miles, There's someone on their knees.
Lifting my name to the Lord above. In joy and pain,
I can feel the love. And see you smile. Across the miles.


Life can be so complicated, Walking through it on
your own. When kindred hearts are separated, It
gives love a chance, to grow. And even though I am
so far away, Oh I am reminded every day.

Across the miles, Across the miles.
