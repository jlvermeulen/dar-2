I’m at a payphone
I threw a wish in the well,
Don’t ask me, I’ll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you’re in my way
I trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you’re in my way

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I’m paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I’m at a payphone
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here’s my number,
So call me, maybe?
It’s hard to look right,
At you baaaaby
Here’s my number

I’m at a payphone trying to call home
All of my changes I spent on you
Where have the time gone,
Baby it’s all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist (I’m wide awake)
I would still be holding you like this (I’m wide awake)
All those fairy tales are full of it (I’m wide awake)
One more stupid love song I’ll be sick

Yeah, falling from cloud 9
(it was out of the blue I’m),
Crashing from the high (I wish I knew then
Letting go tonight (what I know now wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down)
Falling from cloud 9
Star-ships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let’s do this one last time
Let’s do this one more time
One more time, one more time,
One more time

Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
Tonight

Call me maybe at a payphone
wide awake and standing on
a star-ship waiting while
we’re young tonight!
