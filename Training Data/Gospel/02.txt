Brother afar from the Savior today
Risking your soul for the things that decay
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul

What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul

Mercy is calling you, won't you give heed
Must the dear Savior still tenderly plead
Risk not your soul, it is precious indeed
What would you give in exchange for your soul

More than the silver and gold of the earth
More than all jewels thy spirit is worth
God the creator has given it birth
What would you give in exchange for your soul
