I wandered again to my home in the mountains
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me

Everybody I met (everybody I met)
Seemed to be a rank stranger (seemed to be a rank stranger)
No mother nor dad (no mother or dad)
Not a friend could I see (not a friend could I see)
They knew not my name (they knew not my name)
And I knew not their faces (and I knew not their faces)
I found they were all (I found they were all)
Rank strangers to me (rank strangers to me)

"They've all moved away," said the voice of a stranger
"To a beautiful land by the bright crystal sea"
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me

Everybody I met (everybody I met)
Seemed to be a rank stranger (seemed to be a rank stranger)
No mother nor dad (no mother or dad)
Not a friend could I see (not a friend could I see)
They knew not my name (they knew not my name)
And I knew not their faces (and I knew not their faces)
I found they were all (I found they were all)
Rank strangers to me (rank strangers to me)
