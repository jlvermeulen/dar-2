Oh, listen to me, sinners, don't you want to go
For some day He's comin' back again you know
If that wrong ain't righted you'll be lost in sin
Get in line, brother, He will take you in

Get in line brother if you wanna go home
Get on your knees and righten that wrong
Then you'll be singing this old time song
Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home

Oh, listen to me, Satan, I have righted that wrong
Got a one way ticket and I'm goin' home
I've got no worries as I sing this song
Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home

Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home
Get on your knees and righten that wrong
Then you'll be singing this old time song
Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home

If I could tell you, brother, just how I feel
Then I'm sure you'll know the love of God is real
Then you'll be praying while I sing this song
Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home

Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home
Get on your knees and righten that wrong
Then you'll be singing this old time song
Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home
