I know that I don’t bring a lot to the table 
Just little pieces of a broken heart 
There’s days I wonder if you’ll still be faithful 
Hold me together when I fall apart 
Would you remind me now of who you are? 

That your love will never change, that there’s healing in your name 
And that you can take broken things and make them beautiful 
You took my shame and you walked out of the grave 
So your love can take broken things and make them 
Beautiful and make them beautiful 

I’m better off when I begin to remember 
How you have met me in my deepest pain 
So give me glimpses now of how you have covered 
All of my heartache, oh, with all your grace 
Remind me now that you can make a way 

That your love will never change, that there’s healing in your name 
And that you can take broken things and make them beautiful 
You took my shame and you walked out of the grave 
So your love can take broken things and make them 
Beautiful and make them beautiful 

You say that you’ll turn my weeping into dancing 
Remove my sadness and cover me with joy 
You say your scars are the evidence of healing 
That you can make the broken beautiful 

‘Cause your love will never change, and there’s healing in your name 
And you will take broken things and make them beautiful 
You took my shame and you walked out of the grave 
So your love can take broken things and make them 
Beautiful and make them beautiful 
and make them beautiful you make us beautiful you make us beautiful!
