Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin' and smiling in the photobooth
We got closer
Soon you were eating off my spoon
And coming over and we would talk all afternoon

And it's dark in a cold December
I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend you
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on

Tonight take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sissy look in your eyes
And I know we ain’t friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We’ll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like it’s do or die
And take me to the other side

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way
You take me all the way

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
It makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy
(I want you to stay)
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity
(I want you to stay)

I've got my ticket for the long way 'round
The one with the prettiest of views
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I'm leaving tomorrow, whatdya say

I need your love
(If our love is tragedy)
I really wanna love somebody

I need your love
(If our love's insanity)
I really wanna love somebody

Na na na na na na na, hey, hey, hey
Na na na na na na na, hey, hey, hey, hey, Anthem Lights

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight 'til it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
