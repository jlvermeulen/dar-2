All you fellows, gather 'round me
And let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice
While you're out cheating on your woman
There's something you never even thought of, and that is

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

I've seen so, so many fellows
Fall in that same old bag
Thinking that a woman is made to,
To be beat on and treated so bad
Oh, fellows, let me ask you something
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of,

I know there are some women gives the other excuse
I'm not tryin' to run your life, boy it's up to you
Oh, you oh, you,

Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late
Oh, that's when it all happened
Something I never, never dreamed of

Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Now who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love
(Who? Who? Your old lady) (While you were out making love)
