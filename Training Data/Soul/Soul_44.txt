Hey Greg! 
What? 
All we need is a drummer, 
For people who only need a beat, yeah!
I'm gonna add a little guitar 
And make it easy to move your feet 
I'm gonna add some bottom, 
So that the dancers just won't hide 
You might like to hear my organ 
I said 'Ride Sally Ride' Cynthia, Jerry!!
You might like to hear the horns blowin', 
Cynthia on the throne, yeah! 
Listen to me
All the squares, go home! 
Aaaaah, yeah!!!
