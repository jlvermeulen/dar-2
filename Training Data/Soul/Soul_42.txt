I've got dreams
Dreams to remember
I've got dreams Dreams to remember

Honey I saw you there last night
Another mans arms holding you tight
Nobody knows what I feeled inside
All I know, I walked away and cried

I've got dreams
Dreams to remember
I've got dreams, rough dreams Dreams to remember

I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw him kiss you again and again
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me
Why did he hold you so tenderly?

I've got dreams
Dreams to remember
I've got dreams
Dreams, rough dreams
Dreams to remember

I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway
I still don't want you to ever leave
Girl, you just satisfy me!

I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw you kiss him again and again
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me
Why did he hold you so tenderly?

I've got dreams
Dreams to remember
I've got dreams
Dreams, bad dreams
Dreams, rough dreams
To remember
Don't make me suffer
Dreams, bad dreams
Dreams, rough dreams
To remember
