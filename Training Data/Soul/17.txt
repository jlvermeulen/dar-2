Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart

You don't remember me, but I remember you
T'was not so long ago, you broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart
Caused by you

If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back and tempt the hands of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart
Caused by you

Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
They'll fill your heart with joy

If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back and tempt the hands of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart
Caused by you

Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart
Caused by you
Caused by you
