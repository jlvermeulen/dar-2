When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got, yeah
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can never do her wrong
He can never want some other girl

Yes, when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby
You're my world

When a man loves a woman
