Mother, mother, there's too many of you crying 
Brother, brother, brother, there's far too many of you dying 
You know we'ver got to find a way 
To bring some lovin' here today, hey 

Father, father, we don't need to escalate 
War is not the answer, for only love can conquer hate 
You know we've got to find a way 
To bring some lovin' here today 

Picket lines and picket signs 
Don't punish me with brutality 
Talk to me, so you can see 
Oh what's going on, what's going on 
Yeah, what's going on, ah, what's going on 
Ahhh.... 

Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong 
Ah but who are they to judge us 
Simply 'cos our hair is long 
Ah you know we'ver got to find a way 
To brind some understanding here today 

Picket lines and picket signs 
Don't punish me with brutality 
Talk to me, so you can see 
What's going on, yeah what's going on 
Tell me what's going on, I'll tell you what's going on
