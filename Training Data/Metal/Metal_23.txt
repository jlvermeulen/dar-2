Unknown heir
Orphaned page
A King to be
Come his Age
For God's sake

Sorcerer
Sword in Stone
Release will
Bring the Throne
For the Chosen One

The Almighty will point out
The only royal blood in the crowd

Excalibur
Sword of the kings
Take me on your wings
Back where I belong
Excalibur

Unworthy
Bound to fail
Noble Heart
Bound to gain
Challenge your faith!

Sorcerer
Sword in Stone
Release it
Ascend the Throne and
Take the crown

The Almighty now throws the dice
Arthur the man without a vice

Precious Sword
Arthur's hand
He deserves
To rule the land
Lead Britannia

Excalibur lights up the sky
Hard times have been passing by
