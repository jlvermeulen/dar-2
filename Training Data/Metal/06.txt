I’ve been running, I’ve been gone
Not forthcoming, for so long
Disillusioned, heartless too
Convoluted, through and through

[Chorus:]
But I’m Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed

I am tired, breaking down
I’m unwired, tied and bound

[Chorus:]
But I’m Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed

I look to the sky, I see You all around
When I close my eyes, I dream that I am found
You’re standing there, you’re power I can feel
You move upon me, like a river made of steel

[Chorus:]
But I’m Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed
Yes I’m Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed
