Gimme fuel,
Gimme fire,
Gimme that which I desire,
Ooh!

Turn on... I see red
Adrenaline crash & crash my head
Nitro junkie, pin me dead
And I see red

One hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white knuckles tight
Through black & white

Ohhh, On I burn,
Fuel is pumping engines,
Burning hard, loose & clean

And I burn,
Turning my direction,
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel,
Gimme fire,
Gimme that which I desire,

Ooh

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah!

Take the corner, join the crash,
Headlights, headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, oohhOH!

Ohhh, gn I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose & clean

And on I burn
Churning my direction,
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Yeah-heah

White knuckle tight!

Gimme fuel... (On I burn, on and on)
Gimme fire... (On I burn, on and on)
My desire...

Ohhh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose & clean

And I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh

On I burn!
