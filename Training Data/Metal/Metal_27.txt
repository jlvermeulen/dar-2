One, two, three, go

Right when I need you most, don't you move
Keep your feet planted right where you stand
Right where I need you here so much closer than before

It's finally over
No pretending, this is real

I should have never brought you here
I should have told you from the start to run
I should have never let you leave
You were the only one

I should have never brought you here
I should have told you from the start to run
I should have never let you leave

Cut off at arms length, tell me I'm everything
Still it means nothing to you
The threat of letting go, this pain an empty room
Is now all that I know

It's finally over
No pretending, this is real

I should have never brought you here
I should have told you from the start to run
I should have never let you leave
You are the only one

I should have never brought you here
I should have told you from the start to run
I should have never let you leave

We kiss and we say goodnight
You walk away and I can't think twice
The thoughts run over and over
It's finally over

I should have never brought you here
I should have told you from the start to run
I should have never let you leave

Right when I need you most, don't you move
Keep your feet planted right where you stand
Right where I need you here so much closer than before

It's finally over
It's finally over
It's finally over
