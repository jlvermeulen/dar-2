Life...
Tired of what I call mine.
So, again, dream
Leaving the space I define.
So, again...

Soul...
Craving for something so new.
So, I'll get no
Answer the voices, some clue
So again...

Waiting for time... to become like a fragile rain
Falling from the sky.
Looking for ways... to believe that I'm not the same
It's all in my mind.

Once in a while... there's a child in your eyes and mind.
Now that I know, I'll be ready to go, when you stay.

Sun...
Shining its rays in my eyes.
So, get close.
Painful to see it's not right.
So again...

Dream...
Moving to places we'll change.
So I can believe
Nothing is searching my way.
So again...

Waiting for time... to become like a fragile rain
Falling from the sky.
Looking for ways... to believe that I'm not the same
It's all in my mind.

Once in a while... there's a child in your eyes and mind.
Now that I know, I'll be ready to go, when you stay.

You are the sun... shining light into love and life.
Placing it all... I just wanna move on... and warm.

Breathe... slow...

Waiting for time... to become like a fragile rain
Falling from the sky.
Looking for ways... to believe that I'm not the same
It's all in my mind.

Once in a while... there's a child in your eyes and mind.
Now that I know, I'll be ready to go, when you stay.

You are the sun, shining light into love and life.
Facing it all... I just wanna move on... and warm.

Once in a while, I see your child. 
Once in a while... Bye bye... my little child.
