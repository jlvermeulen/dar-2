As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide

She left her letter beside her bed
And it read that she would be dead
By the time that read it
There was a trail of blood that lead
Down to the cellar and that’s where
That’s where I found her

So beautiful with a blood stained head
I wish I could’ve been there

As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide

And in this letter now I write
Why I must now say goodnight forever
And on that day, my heart died
And with this bullet I’ll take my life
God damn her!!!

So beautiful with a blood stained head
I wish I could’ve been there

As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide

As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide
As the daylight died on the summertime suicide

Suicide
Suicide
Suicide!
