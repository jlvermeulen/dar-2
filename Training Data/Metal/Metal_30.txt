To the sound of the monstrance clock
Air is cleansed, assembled flock
Black candles burn, all minds aligned

To the sound of the monstrance clock
Air is cleansed, assembled flock
Black candles burn, all minds aligned

As the parish sighs in smoke
Enters the lady revealed of cloak
To the haunting sound of the monstrance clock
Singing

Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son

To the sound of the end of day
Mesmerized, the assembled sway
Black candles burn, all minds aligned

Hypnotizing horns of ram
Paralyzing pentagram
And the eerie sound of the monstrance clock
Singing

Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer’s son
Come together, together as a one
Come together, forever as one
