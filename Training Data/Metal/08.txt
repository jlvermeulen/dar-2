Spartan warrior made of steel
Only born to fight and kill
Fighting for destiny
Fighting be forever free

Thousands lying everywhere
Persian soldiers in despair
Hey, hay! No remorse!
Hoy, Hoy! Killing force!

We fight for revolution
Killing for retribution
Enemies forever, execution

Sacrifice this night for the Helladic nation
Three hundred in blood
Falling one by one side by side for the ancient gods
Three hundred in blood

Spartan comes like hurricane
Killing ecstasy insane
Faster, faster, killing faster
Persian soldier - blood disaster

Spartans never fall in flames
Spartans be forever brave
Bloodless now they loose control
Try again to kill 'em all

We fight for revolution
Enemies forever, execution

Sacrifice this night for the Helladic nation
Three hundred in blood
Falling one by one side by side for the ancient gods
Three hundred in blood

We fight for revolution
Killing for retribution
Enemies forever, execution

Sacrifice this night for the Helladic nation
Three hundred in blood
Falling one by one side by side for the ancient gods
Three hundred in blood
