You indulge your pet whim big time
You´re a jumpin´ Jack straight all the way
You´d climb the highest mountain to cash in all the day
Dirty mind clean suit and tie artificial smile to hide your lies
Neck deep you´re in corruption the dirt jsu testifies

When there is smoke there´s fire
Where fire is there´s heat
In the heat you smell the pyre
Underneath your feet

You´re living on payola and shenanigans dervish dance
A four leaf clover in the devil´s oww hands
You´re slipping over to the other side devil´s child
Stored in the black book where achivements are filed

On your way you´ll stop at nothing
You´re deserving one but you take six
A deeper sense behind it three times it spells your fix

When there is smoke there´s fire
Where fire is there´s heat
In the heat you smell the pyre
Underneath your feet

You´re living on payola and shenanigans dervish dance
A four leaf clover in the devil´s own hands
You´re slipping over to the other side devil´s child
Stored in the black book where achivements are filed

When there is smoke there´s fire
Where fire is there´s heat
In the heat you smell the pyre
Underneath your feet 
And I don´t give a damn huh huh

You´re living on payola and shenanigans dervish dance
A four leaf clover in the devil´s own hands
You´re slipping over to the other side devil´s child
Stored in the black book where achivements are filed
Oh oh oh you´re living on payola and shenanigans dirty hands
