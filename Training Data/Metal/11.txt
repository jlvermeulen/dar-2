Judas - I am sworn to avenge
The obsessor with the poison tongue
Slow death unto in the name of revenge
You seek a fragile peace but the damage is done

I will drain the lifeblood from your heart
I will tear your fucking world apart
I will spit on your grave

[Chorus]
Dead man walking
Walking to the jaws of Hell
Dead man talking
A preacher to the ones that failed

Broken - Never king for a day
A hero in a world of one
Face down in a pool of decay
Twisted by the torment of the slaughter to come

I will drain the lifeblood from your heart
I will tear your fucking world apart
You can never be saved

[Chorus]

History dictates that you created nothing
But a veil of lies the fact remains
Sticks and stones still the words keep coming
Dead mans dignity
Standing one foot in the grave

The lamb is led to slaughter
The lamb will beg to be released

Dead man walking
Walking to the jaws of hell
Dead man walking
A precher to the ones that failed
Dead man...
