I know there's something out there
A world that I should not fear
I sit here and I wonder
Why it's me and no other

Can you see me crawling at you
Not knowing where I'm crawling to
Why don't you save me
Save me, save me, save me

I feel I'm going under
A feeling like no other
I need someone to help me
Just point and I think I'll see

Can you see me crawling at you
Not knowing where I'm crawling to
Why don't you save me
Save me, save me, save me

I know the clock is ticking
I think I am worth saving
My life is going nowhere
I'm trapped, I just can't think clear
