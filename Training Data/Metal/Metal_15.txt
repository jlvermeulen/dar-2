Land of the sunrise
Dew and mist subside
Shadows fade to show
Calm scene meant to blow
Roar of threat is heard
Fills the air inert
Bird of prey in clouds
Hunting souls to shroud
Await the reaper
Call the gravedigger
Flick of scythe been paid
Bomber has just laid

Green man's war brought the dark
Treated us as underdogs
Answer bullets with a bark

Chaos over the sprawl
Warfucks cause our downfall
Armageddon is near
We will all disappear

Possessed by chaos
Metal strikes we're lost
Deaf flood blinding all
Realm of dying calls
No face left in sight
Vengeful appetite
Feed upon our grief
Cherish life you steal
Final battle has begun
For the sake of salvation
Humans never stand as one

Chaos over the sprawl
Warfucks cause our downfall
Armageddon is near
We will all disappear

Smell of burning skin
Bodies peeling sins
Strident sound arrays
Moves this death ballet

Evil's now been sown
Shattered faces shown
Retreat to the lair
Guilty cowards fare

Chaos over the sprawl
Warfucks cause our downfall
Armageddon is near
We will all disappear
