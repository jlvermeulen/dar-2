We’ve built an empire
That in the end we can’t take with us
We walk the high wire
We cross the boundaries and that’s our rush

[Chorus:]
But when we step beyond the other side
There will be nothing to hide – What’s our Legacy?
Will we be humbled far beyond our pride?
Or are we in for a rough ride - What’s our Legacy?

It’s never too late
To sacrifice what doesn’t matter
We hold our own fate
It’s time to swing and be the batter

[Chorus:]
But when we step beyond the other side
There will be nothing to hide – What’s our Legacy?
Will we be humbled far beyond our pride?
Or are we in for a rough ride - What’s our Legacy?
