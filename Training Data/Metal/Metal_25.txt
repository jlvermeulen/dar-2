Oh I feel I'm sacrificed
The full moon shadow's crawling
The crowd is hypnotised - praying for you
Oh I could hear me cry
Echoes resonate at night
My body's paralysed - By this devilish rite
Bewitched by a temptation
Bewitched by a spell
Kiss me for my salvation... way down to hell

Revelation - revelation

Blood Angel - you are my destiny
Look - I know you are real
Blood Angel - give me eternity
In the vampires garden of lust
You burn me to dust

Oh, this long awaited night
I beg to live forever
Just your bitter bite - has kept me alive
Opiated by your will
Craving for the deadly thrill
Lure me away - from death and decay

Revelation - revelation

Blood Angel - you are my destiny
Look - I know you are real
Blood Angel - give me eternity
I'm bleeding to death - anyway

Come taste my blood
Your virus in my veins
Pulsating like a heartbeat
But I can feel no pain
Like everlasting lovers
The night will be our day
We live one from the other
So carry my soul away

Revelation - revelation
In a long awaited night
Revelation - revelation
And I wanna feel your might

Blood Angel - you are my destiny
Look - I know you are real
Blood Angel - give me eternity
I'm, trapped in your garden of lust
Oh vampires lust
You burn me to dust

5. I Hear You Cry

I said why!? I really don't know why?
You want me to deny
All the things we're fighting for

Right now - there's nothing left to say
You throw it all away -
the passion and the good memories of our life

How am I supposed to feel?
What am I supposed to say?
Do you hear me crying through the rain?

I hear you cry - the words for lovers
I don't know why the flames still burn
I hear you cry in dreams for lovers
I don't know how - I could return
Yes and now - I'm waiting for your sign

I will pay - for all the things we've lost
I'll nail it on my cross
You burn it down with a million flames

Hell - I'm still under your spell
Don't wanna fall apart
Dive into our wishing well

Now we're standing here alone
The ruins of our love are grown
Do you hear me crying through the rain?

I hear you cry - the words for lovers
I don't know why the flames still burn
I hear you cry in dreams for lovers
I don't know how - I could return
When you cry

Do you hear me?
Can you touch me?
Let all black shadows fade
When I hold you
And I love you ...ah
Let me save you
How I crave you
Let's turn back the pages
The pages of our book of love

I can hear your crying through the rain

I hear you cry - the words for lovers
I don't know why the flames still burn
I hear you cry in dreams for lovers
I don't know how - I could return
I hear you cry - I hear you cry
