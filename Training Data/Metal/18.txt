My friend from above 
Between those clouds 
We stand and watch 
Our mind is greeting us 

Bubbles of a clear day 
And the green plateu of anger 
A field, not a rice field 
We stand under the leaves of a tree 

The river is floating under our feet 
The birds chirp and the butterflies 
Are searching 
No clouds in the sky 
The face of a friend is written into blue of the sky 
Worship of the omnipotent sun (I dream) 
A dive into the mirage 

Straight-angled death 
That instigates the air to reduce 
The stench of my heart dies 
I bury it in my selfishness 

The pain of not knowing - a tense waiting 
A raging fear - when the truth is near 
Who is a friend? The question of my life 
Under the leaven tree - we wait for the answer
