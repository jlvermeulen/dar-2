I'm crucified
Crucified like my Saviour
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

I've seen the deepest darkness
And wrestled with Gods
Ride the noble harness
Raining cats and dogs

I stand before my Maker
Like Moses on the hill
My Guinness record baker
I abide your will

The first of reciter
I saw eternal light
Best of vocal fighter
Beyond human sight

Where thorns are a teaser
I've played a double jeu
Yherushalaim at Easter
I cry I pray mon Dieu
I cry I pray mon Dieu

I'm crucified
Crucified like my Saviour
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

Prophets I've been reading
Stories I've been told
Before I end my breathing
I travel in the soul

Where thorns are a teaser
I've played a double jeu
Yherushalaim at Easter
I cry I pray mon Dieu
I cry I pray mon Dieu
I cry I pray mon Dieu
Adieu mon Dieu

I'm crucified
Crucified like my Saviour
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

I'm crucified
Crucified like my Saviour
Saintlike behavior
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away
