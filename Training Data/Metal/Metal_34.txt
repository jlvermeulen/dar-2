Come on - give me space, some room to be born 
In this eagles eyes my own help is in the grasp of plain nothing 

Dedicated forward we say no more 
This matter of reality, is this what you believe? 
Storm thru our hell with no remorse 
Give me wings to escape your matter of reality

And I know this world is nothing for you 
given nothing to call your own 
so if you just turn away - Chaos

Dedicated forward we say no more 
Storm thru our hell with no remorse 
This battleï¬?eld is our home 
We cannot hide

WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
(Gimme wings, wings to believe) 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 

WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
(Gimme wings, wings to believe) 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 

I am afraid of leaving it all behind 
A place called home - Would I be lost 
I am afraid of leaving it all behind 
A place called home - I wouldn't wanna know

WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 

Dedicated forward we say no more 
Storm thru our hell with no remorse 
This battlefield is our home 
We cannot hide

WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
Dedicated forward we say no more 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
Storm thru our hell with no remorse 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
Dedicated forward we say no more 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
Storm thru our hell

WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE 
WINGS THAT I BELIEVE
